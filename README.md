# rox-wrappers

(c) 2012 Nick Booker

A collection of program wrappers I find useful.

These could just be simple AppFactory wrappers for graphical tools, or
wrappers that call command line programs and provide a GUI of some sort
(whether a savebox or something more complicated).

## Kindle

The Kindle wrapper will attempt to download from Amazon and install the
Windows program under Wine in your home directory, under ~/.kindle-rox/wine

## Debian\_Packages

Some of the wrappers contain a file ```Debian_Packages``` which documents
the names of the package(s) you need to install in Debian in order for
the programs to run.
